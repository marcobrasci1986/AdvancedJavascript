4 Rules:
---------
Call site -> Where and how the function is called. --> only thing that matters

this -> always an object (not primitive or boolean)


1. Is called with 'new' : if so use that object
2. Explicit binding rule: .call() or .apply(); -> foo.call(obj) -> use obj as my this
3. Implicit binding rule: a dot -> object.foo() -> this = base or context object
4. Default binding rule:
in strict -> this = undefined
not in strict -> this = window object


new keyword:
1. Brand new object is created
2. Object gets link to a different object. *
3. New object is this.
4. Implicitly return the object;
