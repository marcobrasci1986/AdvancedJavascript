Javascript is a compiled language, but not like Java.

window == global scope

LHS -> Left hand side (=) -> target
RHS -> Right Hand side -> source

'use strict'; -> var needs to be declared (LHS)

undefined != undeclared;

undefined means is declared but with a special value. Is an actual value
undefined is a type


function first ->  function declaration -> hoisted
var foo = function(){}
    -> named function expression (anonymous function) (IIFE) -> not hoisted


lexical scope -> compile time scope

eval()
